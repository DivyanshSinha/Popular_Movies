# Popular Movie Project (Stage 1)

## Overview
This project is a part of the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree.
In this project (stage 1 of 2), we were prompted to build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing. 
And also make a setting option for displaying top-rated films.
When a user clicks on a movie poster it opens another activity with all the details of the movie.
    
## Running the app
This app utilizes the [Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/). 
To run this app, you must obtain a free API key from the MovieDB website.
And then insert it in the MainActivity.java file where it says `<INSERT API KEY HERE>`
